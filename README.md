# ✈️ Airline Ticketing AI Agent Chat App

This project implements an **AI-powered chatbot** for a flight ticketing system.  
The chatbot interprets **natural language messages** and uses **OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 model** to identify the user’s intent.  
All requests are routed through a **.NET Ocelot API Gateway**, which then interacts with the **Midterm APIs deployed on Azure**.

---

### ✅ Supported Intents

- ✈️ **QueryFlight** – Find available flights  
- 🎫 **BuyTicket** – Purchase tickets  
- 🪪 **CheckIn** – Assign seat number to passenger  
- 👥 **QueryPassengerList** – View passengers on a flight
